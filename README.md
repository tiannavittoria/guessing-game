Hello! Thank you for visiting my guessing-game. This is a tutorial I did through MDN Web Docs. I am learning Javascript, Git & GitHub. This was a great tutorial to help strengthen my skillsets in all areas. 


Skills I practiced today:

1. I forked MDN/learning-area on github

2. I used git init to create a new local repository called "MDN Tutorials"

3. I changed to that directory in Git

4. I cloned the repository with Git into my local "MDN Tutorials" repository

5. I followed the tutorial and created the project using VSCode.

6. I then decided to give this tutorial it's own repository on GitHub. Therefore, I created a repository within GitHub called "guessing-game". 

7. I had some trouble pushing the file to GitHub using the command line. 

8. I decided to init a new project folder and html file locally. I copied the html project into the new local repo. 

9. After much practice I was able to push my local repo to GitHub. 

10. Once my repository was up on Github I added some content to the README file and started a new branch. 

11. I pulled the branch down to my local computer.

12. I created a ReadME explaining the workflow on tutorial project.

13. Next I will push the new changes in the branch to GitHub and make a pull request to merge the changes into the master.

14. I will then delete branch-2.
